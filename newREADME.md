#### Question 1
Write a program and ask the user to enter a number.
The number should be between 1 to 10. If the user enters a valid number, 
display "Valid" on the console.
Otherwise, display "Invalid".
(This logic is used a lot in applications where values 
entered into input boxes need to be validated.)
